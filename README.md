# Physax: Physis JAX

Physax (Physis JAX) is a high-performance digital evolution simulation optimized for GPUs using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). It simulates a population of "organisms" whose behavior is defined by evolving genomes.

Physax is built upon the theoretical framework of self-replicating digital organisms in Tierra-like systems. The core research objectives—exploring the evolvability of the genotype-phenotype relation—are detailed in the following  paper: Attila Egri-Nagy and Chrystopher L. Nehaniv. Evolvability of the Genotype-Phenotype Relation in Populations of Self-Replicating Digital Organisms in a Tierra-Like System. In Wolfgang Banzhaf, Jens Ziegler, Thomas Christaller, Peter Dittrich, and Jan T. Kim, editors, Advances in Artificial Life, pages 238–247. Springer, 2003. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-39432-7_26
